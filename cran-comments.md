## fastTS 0.1.2 release summary

This is a resubmission that fixes an incorrectly formatted
DOI link that was caught in the previous submission. 

The previous submission was a re-naming and otherwise minor update 
to the existing srlTS R package.

We are seeking to rename because: 1) srlTS is too specific as our package 
can implement the sparsity-ranked MCP and SCAD methods in addition 
to the SRL, and 2) better visibility.
